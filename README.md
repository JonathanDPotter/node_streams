# node_streams

## Part One

I built this app for the TrueCoders Node Streams exercise with HTML, CSS,
JavaScript and Node.js.

I used this exercise to learn about using Node streams, but also to
practice adding .js and .css files to m HTML in Node.js projects.

## Part Two

The pokemon JSON writing app is in the utils folder and is named writePokemon.js.

There is a script in the package.json called "write" to run it.
